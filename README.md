# Manga-Updates-Webscraper
Script that scrapes information on mangas from mangaupdates.com and writes the data into a csv file. Dependent on requests and bs4. Example of 10 mangas scraped provided.
Used by client to sort mangas by availability and popularity to determine which titles to begin scanlating.

Currently set to scrape the first 10 manga IDs at a rate of 1 request per second, quick edit will be needed to scrape more. There is no robots.txt so just be mindful with use.
